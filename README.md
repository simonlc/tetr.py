# Tetr.py

Tetr.py, based on [Tetr.js](https://simon.lc/tetr.js) - ([Github](https://github.com/simonlc/tetr.js))

It was created with the intention of being played on the Miyoo Mini handheld. It may work with third party OS's but I've only had it work on the stock OS. These builds of [parasyte](https://github.com/steward-fu/miyoo-mini/releases/download/stock/parasyte_20220125.zip) and [pygame](https://github.com/steward-fu/miyoo-mini/releases/download/stock/python3_pygame_20220223.zip) are required to play.
